            <h2>The Origins of Handles Ice Cream</h2>
            <p>Handel’s Homemade Ice Cream traces its origins to 1945, when founder Alice Handel began making ice cream using fresh fruit from her own backyard in Youngstown, Ohio. 
                What started as a small, family-run operation quickly gained a loyal following for its rich texture, high butterfat content, and emphasis on handmade, small-batch production. 
                Over the decades, the business remained rooted in its original recipes and commitment to quality, gradually expanding beyond Ohio through franchising while maintaining the “homemade” brand identity.
                 Today, Handel’s operates dozens of locations across multiple U.S. states and is widely recognized for combining a long-standing family legacy with consistent product quality, positioning it as both a nostalgic and competitive player in the premium ice cream market.</p>
